This Power BI dashboard explores customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and sales performance using the AdventureWorks dataset. It provides decision-makers with actionable insights on loyalty, age segmentation, revenue drivers, and marketing opportunities across global markets.

## Project Title
Customer Behaviour & Sales Performance Insights (AdventureWorks)

## Description
This project analyzes customer behavior and sales performance using the AdventureWorks dataset.
It covers customer segmentation by age, gender, and family status, while highlighting revenue drivers and loyalty trends.
Key insights drive strategic recommendations around marketing, customer retention, and geo-targeted campaigns.

## Problem Statement
Companies often lack a deep understanding of:
- Which customer groups contribute most to revenue
- How family dynamics and age impact buying behavior
- Whether gender or geography influence sales patterns
- How to convert occasional buyers into loyal customers
This dashboard answers those questions visually empowering smarter, segmented marketing strategies.

## Tools Used
- Power BI

## Process Summary
#### Data Preparation:
- Cleaned AdventureWorks customer & transaction data
- Derived customer age, gender, and child status fields
- Grouped customers into loyalty tiers: Loyal, Periodic, VIP
#### Dashboard Design
- KPIs: Total Revenue, Avg Customer Age, Number of Customers, Quantity Ordered, Transactions, Gender Split
- Revenue bar chart showing each age category vs the average revenue line
- Segmentation visuals — donut charts for “Customers With Children” vs “Without Children” and bar comparison for Loyal, Periodic, VIP customers
- Ranking bars listing the top-5 “Estimated Buyers” for quick high-value targeting

## Key Insights
- $307M Total Revenue from 18.48K customers
- 71% of customers have children → Huge family-oriented market
- 31–40 Age Group leads with $80M revenue, far above average
- Loyal Customers drive $273M out of $307M → Strong retention success
- US leads in customers with children; Australia leads in customers without children
- Balanced gender mix, but further revenue trend by gender is recommended
- VIP customers underperform, showing need for loyalty strategy revision

## Recommendations
- Expand Loyalty Programs for “Loyal” and “Periodic” buyers
- Develop Age-Specific Campaigns, especially for 31–60 range
- Leverage Family-Focused Messaging across child-heavy markets like the US
- Review & Improve VIP Strategy—enhance benefits or redefine segment
- Use “Estimated Buyers” as a targeting tool for top customer outreach
- Explore Gender-Based Trend Analysis for future product targeting
- Apply Geo-Demographic Campaigns—tailor marketing by region (e.g., US vs Australia)

## Challenges & Fixes
- Age & Child segmentation logic: Fixed with derived columns in Power Query
- Disproportionate category sizes: Standardized with % charts
- Limited VIP engagement: Flagged for deeper CRM analysis
